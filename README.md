# nothingofvalue - a webserver of least possible value

Nothing of value is here.

A self-contained webserver which strives to be of as little use as possible,
as a musing on the modern zombie internet.

Serves a single homepage of no great value, a /robots.txt forbidding all
robotic crawls, and on all other possible URLs serves content of the least
productive value possible, while keeping locally-consumed resources modest.

Notable valueless offerings include decompression bombs for common image
codecs and transport encodings, exponentially self-expanding markup language
documents, made-up credentials, and similar.


Usage: 

```
  go run main/main.go --listen=localhost:8080
```
